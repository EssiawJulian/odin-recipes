    <p>
      To make fried rice, you will need the following ingredients: cooked and
      chilled rice, eggs, carrots, peas, onions, garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce
      (optional), toasted sesame oil, and green onions. The recipe typically
      involves sautéing the vegetables, adding the rice, soy sauce, and oyster
      sauce, and then stirring in the eggs. The dish can be customized with
      additional ingredients such as bacon, chicken, or ham. The key to
      achieving an authentic Chinese taste is using sesame oil. The entire
      process takes about 15 minutes and can be made in one pan for easy cleanup

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and
        stir mushrooms until liquid has evaporated, and mushrooms are browned,
        about 15 minutes. Set mushrooms aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fluff cooked rice with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to
        separate the grains. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok
        over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, garlic, and ginger until fragrant,
        about 1 minute. Add celery, onion, and carrot. Cook and stir until
        vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in bell pepper and
        cooked mushrooms just until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in cooked rice, lightly tossing until rice is heated through and
        thoroughly combined with pork and vegetables. Stir in soy sauce, remove
        from heat, and sprinkle green onions over the top.
